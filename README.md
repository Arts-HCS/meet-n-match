# Meet n' Match

**Meet n Match** is a dynamic web platform that helps people connect with others who share their interests, age range, gender, and location. Built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and Leaflet for interactive maps, this project goes beyond social networking — it allows users to form meaningful communities that can evolve into music bands, clubs, or even businesses.

## Features

- Create or join interest-based groups by filtering age, gender, and location.
- Interactive map with Leaflet.js to search or detect your current location.
- Simple logic for future business accounts or professional group upgrades.
- JSON-based mock database for users, interests, and groups (easy to replace with SQL later).
